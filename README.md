## Implementation

- Everything from the exercises
- Reduced screen shake to make it less jarring
- Changed base paddle color and particle effect color to better fir the theme
- Made Edges of the screen fit better and changed their color
- Made back ground shader of the main menu be a checker board of 2 primary colors that was checkered every other pixel so that the colors would blend together seamlessly to the eye
	- These colors are also hooked up to sinTime and cosinTime so they interchange differently
		- I didn't like how when i initial did this that there would be periods of black so i used the shader's absolute value operation to limit the range away from it looking black
